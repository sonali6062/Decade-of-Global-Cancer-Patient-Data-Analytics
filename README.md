# Decade of Global Cancer Patient Data Analytics

## 📌 Overview
This project provides an exploratory analysis of **global cancer patient data over a decade**.  
Using Jupyter Notebook, the analysis highlights **temporal trends, geographical variations, and distribution of cancer types**, with visualizations and statistical insights that can support research and public health policies.
